# Wiimote-EEPRROM-backup
Binary dump of the 128kb eeprom chip from my wiimote (was damaged due to corrosion but I managed to extract the data through careful soldering), replaced with identical chip.
Attached is an arduino sketch and the dump which may be of use to someone (it uses generic i2c eeprom library)
